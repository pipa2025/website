# Bergen, Norway   |   1-5 September, 2025

The University of Bergen welcomes researchers working in the field of Plasma Physics and Astrophysics 
to the 4th edition of the Conference on “Partially Ionised Plasmas in Astrophysics” in Bergen during 1-5 of September 2025.

The dynamics of partially ionised astrophysical plasmas is a rapidly growing topic of research. Plasma partial ionisation effects are present in different astrophysical environments, such as stellar atmospheres, interstellar medium, protostellar discs, planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres, etc. The meeting aims to broaden and strengthen the collaboration of scientists working in partially ionised plasmas in astrophysics and space science and to develop common scientific interest that could enhance cross-collaborations between the different fields. The meeting will focus on the following topics:

1. Fundamental atomic and energy transport in partially ionised plasmas: charge exchange, radiation transport, chemical reactions, etc
2. Fundamental dynamical processes in partially ionised plasmas: waves, instabilities, dynamo, turbulence, etc.
3. Observations and modelling of space and astrophysical partially ionised plasmas

<!-- The meeting is supported by:

The Scientific Program includes invited and keynote lectures and contributed talks. The Social Program includes a walking tour over Bergen, and a conference dinner. The conference registration fee includes all the coffee breaks, the conference material, social program and all lunches.
